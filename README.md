# Unit-4-Game
Crystals Collector

# Description
This is another interactive game that utilizes the jQuery identifier to capture events.

# Directions
The user will click on 4 images with hidden values in order to reach a specified target number that is random chosen.  If the user meets the target number, then the game resets and the wins increases by one.  If the user exceeds the target number, then the game resets and the losses increases by one.

# Purpose
This game was built using pseudo code and logic structure to assist new JavaScript users.  Users should be able to identify the use of .click, .html, .on, and .ready events.  It is also a great example of JavaScript's Math.Min and Math.Max operators.
