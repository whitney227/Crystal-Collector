# Directions
The user will click on 4 images with hidden values in order to reach a specified target number that is randomly chosen.  If the user meets the target number, then the game resets and the wins increases by one.  If the user exceeds the target number, then the game resets and the losses increases by one.

# Technical Approach
This game was built in JavaScript using math objects like Math.floor and Math.random to calculate the value of assigned variables.  Through jQuery methods, the values are updated in the browser window.
